# Ade Yuliandi â€” Portfolio (Final)

This is a ready-to-deploy static portfolio site for GitHub Pages.
Included files:
- index.html (landing page with live demo modal + inline PDF viewer)
- Digital_Hustle_Ebook.pdf (demo PDF)
- sample1.png, sample2.png, sample3.png (demo images)
- README.md (this file)

## Quick deploy (recommended)
1. Create a GitHub repository named `your-username.github.io`.
2. Upload all files from this package to the repository root (don't keep them inside a nested folder).
3. Commit & push. Wait a minute, then open: `https://your-username.github.io`.

## Notes
- Filenames are case-sensitive on GitHub Pages. Do not change names unless you update references in index.html.
- The page loads fonts and pdfjs via CDN. If assets don't load, check browser console for errors.
